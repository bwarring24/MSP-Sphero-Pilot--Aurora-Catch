# MSP-Sphero-Pilot--Aurora-Catch

###Description:

Aurora Catch is a new way to play catch. Unlike normal catch games it requires two people, but with the Sphero you can do this with just a single person and the Sphero. When you roll a ball the ball does not role back to you, but Aurora Catch changes that. With Aurora Catch you will be able to roll the Sphero across the room and it will automatically roll right back to you!




###How Does it Work?

With Sphero's sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope) we are able to take advantage of this information and do a lot of cool things with it. I will be able to track Sphero's position so if it is rolled and hits a wall and changes course we are able to understand this information and when Sphero needs to roll back our program can roll it back even if it had turned a few times.
